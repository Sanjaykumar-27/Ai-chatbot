# 🧠 Simple Chatbot

This is a basic chatbot application built using vanilla JavaScript. It interacts with users by recognizing specific keywords and providing predefined responses in a conversational interface.

## 💡 Features

- Simple keyword-based chatbot logic
- Dynamic message display (user and bot messages)
- Scrollable message container
- Easy-to-understand DOM manipulation
- Instant response simulation with delay

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## 🚀 How It Works

The chatbot listens for user input, matches keywords against a set of predefined responses, and returns an appropriate message. If no match is found, a default message is returned.
